Welcome to Recipes-by-Sam (working title)! Although inspired by project work, this will be my first website will show to friend's and family.
I've kept the original HTML only version as a reminder to where I've come from. This version of my website will now feature HTML, CSS, and all the other things I learn.
We really enjoy cooking so this will be a great ongoing project showing casing both the work and fun I have with programming. Can't wait and enjoy the recipes!
Thanks for reading and visiting!
